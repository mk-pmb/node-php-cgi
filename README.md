node-php-cgi
============

npm module to run php scripts from nodejs through cgi. This module was developed for deskshell 
(http://deskshell.org) to allow seamless handling of php scripts.

This is currently an early edition of the code and is aimed at deskshell. 
Contact me if you want to use it for some other purpose and need additional features / support.
